# Com-Eng.ir Archive Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Com-Eng.ir Archive Project. This project is an effort to preserve the valuable resources and knowledge that were once available on the now-defunct website, com-eng.ir. Using the power of the Wayback Machine, we've scraped the most complete version of available snapshots and gathered all necessary resources and scripts to run this website locally.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mobiwn/Com-Eng-Archive
```

## Running Locally

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory. From there, you can start the local server and access the website from your browser.

```bash
cd com-eng-archive/com-eng.ir/
```

Then, open `index.html` file with your web browser and navigate through different pages.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. Whether it's adding missing resources, improving scripts, or enhancing documentation, your help is appreciated. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't have been possible without the Wayback Machine and the open-source community's invaluable tools and resources.
